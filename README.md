---->declared three variables num,div and count.
--->count is pre initialised as 0.
----->input has been assigned to number.
---->gave a conditional statement to check whether the given number is neither prime nor composite.
--->the init is assigned with num.
---->a function isPrime is declared which does recursion and returns  int count value to count variable using parameters num,div,count.
---->int isPrime(int num,int div,int count) is been declared inside int function.
-----> later the count is then checked with conditional statement to check whether the count is prime or not.
---->if the count is 2 then it is prime as prime number divides with itself.
---->if the count is not 2 then it is not prime number.
